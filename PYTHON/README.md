## Technologies Used

The Python projects in this repository utilize the following technologies:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for all the projects.
- **JSON:** Data format used for storing and retrieving quiz questions and answers.
- **Operating System Interaction:** Some projects interact with the operating system to perform tasks like changing the desktop wallpaper.
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib for data visualization.
- **Automation:** Schedule for task automation.
